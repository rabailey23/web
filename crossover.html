<h1 align="center">Crossover designs</h1>

<P>
These are designs for experiments in which treatments are applied to several
people or animals (or other units) and the treatments applied to an 
individual can be changed from one period to the next.  What makes these
different from ordinary row-column designs is that the treatment applied
in the preceding period may have a carryover effect on the person or animal
in the current period.  

<P>
Such experiments are used to compare drugs to
alleviate symptoms of chronic disease; to compare feeds for lactating cows;
to compare the tastes of different cheeses (or wines or beers or types of 
orange juice &hellip;) or find out about human-computer interaction.
